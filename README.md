This is a simple matlab code to blur a B&W picture. MUST NOTE THAT RGB PICTURE WONT WORK HERE.
Image is nothing but colours in a matrix formate, to blur an image we just take just take the mean of the sorrounding matrix value.
And we want to blur a portion of the image so we will need a for loop. The for loop is basic thats why no need to explain it.
and yeah we just put the for loop in in mean and we got our result.
